extends:
  - base
rules:
  - "Prefer immutable data classes over mutable classes."
  - "Use suspend functions and Structured Concurrency for async operations."
  - "Public APIs must be null-safe; use explicit nullable types when needed."
  - "Adopt JUnit5 + MockK + AssertJ for testing as per project policy."
  - "Use sealed classes for restricted class hierarchies."
  - "Prefer extension functions over utility classes."
  - "Use scope functions (let, run, apply, also, with) appropriately."
  - "Follow Kotlin coding conventions for naming and formatting."
  - "Use data classes for value objects."
  - "Leverage Kotlin's stdlib functions (map, filter, fold, etc.)."
