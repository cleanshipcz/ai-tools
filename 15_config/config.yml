# AI Tools Configuration
#
# This file contains shared configuration for the ai-tools repository.
# It is versioned and committed to git.
#
# For user-specific overrides, create config.local.yml (see config.local.yml.example)
#
# Configuration Merging:
# ----------------------
# config.local.yml (if it exists) is merged with this file using these rules:
#   - Scalars: config.local.yml takes priority
#   - Lists: Both lists are merged (config.yml + config.local.yml), duplicates removed
#   - Maps: Recursively merged, config.local.yml takes priority for key conflicts

# Project Sources
# ---------------
# Directories to search for project configurations.
# Paths can be relative (to repository root) or absolute.
#
# These are shared project locations that all team members should use.
# Add personal project directories in config.local.yml instead.
#
# Default: ['./06_projects/global', './06_projects/local']
#
# Examples:
#   - ./06_projects/global         # Versioned, shared projects
#   - ./06_projects/local          # Local, gitignored projects
#   - /absolute/path/to/projects   # Projects in other locations
#   - ../other-repo/projects       # Projects in sibling repository
#
project_sources:
  - ./06_projects/global
  - ./06_projects/local
