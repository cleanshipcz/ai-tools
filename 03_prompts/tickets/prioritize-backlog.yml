  Prioritize the following backlog:

  Items:
  {{backlog_items}}

  {{#business_goals}}
  Business goals: {{business_goals}}
  {{/business_goals}}

  {{#team_capacity}}
  Team capacity: {{team_capacity}}
  {{/team_capacity}}

  Apply these prioritization frameworks:

  ## 1. RICE Scoring
  For each item, calculate:
  - **Reach**: How many users affected? (1-10)
  - **Impact**: How much does it move the needle? (1-10)
  - **Confidence**: How sure are we? (1-10)
  - **Effort**: How many person-days? (estimate)
  - **Score**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

  ## 2. MoSCoW Method
  Categorize items:
  - **Must Have**: Critical for this release
  - **Should Have**: Important but not critical
  - **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
  - **Won't Have**: Not in this release

  ## 3. Value vs Effort Matrix

  ```
  High Value  |  Quick Wins  |  Major Projects
              |              |
  ------------|--------------|------------------
              |              |
  Low Value   |  Fill-ins    |  Time Sinks
              |  Low Effort  |  High Effort
  ```

  Provide:

  1. **Prioritized Backlog**: Ordered list with rationale

  For each item:
  - **Priority Rank**: [1, 2, 3...]
  - **Category**: [Must/Should/Could/Won't]
  - **Value Score**: [1-10]
  - **Effort**: [Story points or days]
  - **RICE Score**: [Calculated]
  - **Dependencies**: Blockers or prerequisites
  - **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]
  - **Rationale**: Why this priority?

  2. **Sprint Recommendations**: What to tackle in next sprint
     - Capacity allocation
     - Focus areas
     - Items to defer

  3. **Technical Debt Items**: Don't ignore technical health
     - Critical tech debt to address
     - When to tackle it

  4. **Quick Wins**: High-value, low-effort items to build momentum

  5. **Strategic Initiatives**: Longer-term items to keep in mind
