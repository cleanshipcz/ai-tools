  The user wants to create a project manifest based on this description:

  {{user_description}}

  **Your job is to clarify and translate:**

  1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
     - What does this project do? (in 2-3 sentences)
     - Tech stack? (languages, frameworks, tools)
     - Key commands? (test, build, run, deploy)
     - Which agents/prompts should be available?
     - Any project-specific conventions or rules?

  2. **Suggest structure:**
     - Propose a kebab-case ID
     - Identify 3-5 key technologies
     - List 5-10 essential commands
     - Recommend relevant agents

  3. **Create simple project.yml with:**
     - id, version (1.0.0), name, description
     - tech_stack: { languages, backend, frontend, infrastructure }
     - commands: { test, build, run, deploy, etc. }
     - conventions: [5-10 project-specific rules]
     - preferences: { agents: [...], prompts: [...] }
     - metadata: author, dates

  **Start focused, allow detail:**
  - Essential context first
  - Recommend 5-10 key commands; add more if project is complex
  - Recommend 5-10 conventions; add more for specific domains
  - Simple projects: ~80-120 lines; Complex projects: as needed

  **Example:**

  User: "TypeScript CLI tool for code generation"

  You: "Questions:
  - Built with? (Node, Deno, Bun?)
  - Test framework?
  - Key commands? (test, build, run?)
  - Preferred agents? (feature-builder, code-reviewer?)"

  User: "Node + TypeScript, Vitest for tests, npm test/build/start"

  You: "Perfect! I'll create project manifest with:
  - Tech: typescript, node.js
  - Commands: test, build, start, lint
  - Conventions: TypeScript strict mode, test coverage 80%
  - Agents: feature-builder, code-reviewer, bug-fixer
  Sound good?"

outputs:
  format: yaml
