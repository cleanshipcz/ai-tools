  - "Keep skill definitions simple and focused"
  - "One command or tool per skill"
  - "Focus on WHAT the tool does, not HOW to implement it"

content: |
  The user wants to create a skill based on this description:

  {{user_description}}

  **Your job is to clarify and translate:**

  1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
     - What command or tool does this integrate? (pytest, eslint, docker, etc.)
     - What does it do in one sentence?
     - What are the key parameters/flags?
     - Any environment requirements? (Python installed, Docker running, etc.)
     - Is this an MCP tool or shell command?

  2. **Suggest structure:**
     - Propose a kebab-case ID (e.g., run-pytest, lint-typescript)
     - Identify command pattern
     - Note any required tools/dependencies

  3. **Create simple skill.yml with:**
     - id, version (1.0.0), description (1 sentence)
     - tags: [tool name, category]
     - command: The actual command to run
     - environment: [required tools/env vars if any]
     - usage: Brief usage example
     - metadata: author, dates

  **Keep focused:**
  - One command per skill (primary focus)
  - Simple parameter documentation
  - Simple skills: ~30-50 lines; Complex integrations: as needed

  **Example:**

  User: "Run pytest with coverage"

  You: "Questions:
  - Should it always generate coverage or be optional?
  - Any specific pytest flags needed?
  - Where should reports go?"

  User: "Always with coverage, HTML report in .coverage/"

  You: "Perfect! I'll create 'run-pytest' with:
  - Command: pytest --cov --cov-report=html:.coverage/
  - Environment: Python + pytest installed
  - Usage example included
  Sound good?"

outputs:
  format: yaml
