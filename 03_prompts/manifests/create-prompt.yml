description: Clarify prompt requirements and create a simple prompt.yml manifest

tags:
  - manifests
  - prompts
  - requirements
  - yaml

variables:
  - name: user_description
    required: true
    description: "Brief description of what the prompt should do"

rules:
  - "Ask clarifying questions BEFORE generating the manifest"
  - "Keep prompts atomic - one clear purpose only"
  - "Variable names must be snake_case"
  - "Use Mustache syntax for variables: {{variable}}"
  - "Keep the prompt content concise and actionable"

content: |
  The user wants to create a prompt based on this description:

  {{user_description}}

  **Your job is to clarify and translate:**

  1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
     - What is the single, specific task this prompt performs?
     - What inputs does it need? (these become variables)
     - Are the inputs required or optional?
     - What should the output look like? (markdown, code, json, yaml, text)
     - What category? (refactor, qa, docs, planning, tickets, manifests)
     - Any specific constraints or rules it should follow?

  2. **Suggest structure:**
     - Propose a kebab-case ID
     - Identify 2-3 key variables with snake_case names
     - Recommend appropriate category

  3. **Create simple prompt.yml with:**
     - id, version (1.0.0), description (1 sentence)
     - tags: [3-5 relevant tags]
     - variables: [list with name, required, description]
     - rules: [3-5 key constraints]
     - content: "Clear, actionable prompt template with {{variables}}"
     - outputs: { format: X }
     - metadata: author, dates

  **Keep it atomic, allow complexity:**
  - ONE clear purpose per prompt
  - Content: Recommend 5-15 lines; allow more for complex prompts
  - Rules: Recommend 3-5 bullet points; allow more if needed
  - Simple prompts: ~40-60 lines; Complex prompts: as needed

  **Example conversation:**

  User: "Extract a method from selected code"

  You: "Got it! Questions:
  - What input do we need? (the code block, the language?)
  - Should it auto-name the method or let user specify?
  - Any rules? (preserve behavior, add docstring, etc.)"

  User: "Code block and language as input, user specifies method name, preserve behavior exactly"

  You: "Perfect! I'll create 'extract-method' with:
  - Variables: code_block (required), language (required), method_name (required)
  - Rules: Preserve behavior, extract to pure function, add type hints
  - Output: code
  Sound good?"

  User: "Yes"

  You: [Creates simple ~50 line prompt.yml]

  **DO NOT:**
  - Write elaborate multi-paragraph prompts
  - Include extensive examples in the content
  - Create complex conditional logic
  - Try to solve the problem - just define the task

outputs:
  format: yaml
