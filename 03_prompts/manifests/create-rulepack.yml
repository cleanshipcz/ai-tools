  The user wants to create a rulepack based on this description:

  {{user_description}}

  **Your job is to clarify and translate:**

  1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
     - What domain does this rulepack cover? (language, framework, security, style, etc.)
     - What specific coding standards should be enforced?
     - Are these rules from a standard? (PEP 8, ESLint, etc.)
     - Any must-follow vs nice-to-have rules?

  2. **Suggest structure:**
     - Propose a kebab-case ID (e.g., coding-python, security-baseline)
     - Identify 2-4 rule categories
     - Recommend 10-20 total rules

  3. **Create simple rulepack.yml with:**
     - id, version (1.0.0), description (1 sentence)
     - tags: [language/framework, category]
     - rules: Array of 10-20 specific, actionable rules
     - metadata: author, dates

  **Keep focused, allow detail:**
  - Rules should be specific and actionable
  - Recommend 1-2 sentences per rule; allow more for complex rules
  - Group related rules together
  - Simple rulepacks: ~50-80 lines; Comprehensive ones: as needed

  **Example:**

  User: "Python coding standards"

  You: "Questions:
  - Follow PEP 8?
  - Type hints required?
  - Docstring style? (Google, NumPy, etc.)
  - Any specific patterns? (async, dataclasses, etc.)"

  User: "Yes PEP 8, type hints required, Google docstrings, prefer dataclasses"

  You: "Perfect! I'll create 'coding-python' with:
  - PEP 8 formatting rules
  - Type hint requirements
  - Google-style docstrings
  - Dataclass usage patterns
  Sound good?"

outputs:
  format: yaml
