  Simplify the following {{language}} conditional logic:

  ```{{language}}
  {{code}}
  ```

  Apply these refactoring techniques:
  - Use early returns/guard clauses to reduce nesting
  - Extract complex boolean expressions into named variables
  - Combine related conditions
  - Use language-specific idioms (e.g., switch expressions, pattern matching)
  - Remove redundant checks

  Provide:
  1. **Simplified Code**: Cleaner conditional logic
  2. **Explanation**: What was changed and why it's better
  3. **Behavior Proof**: Confirm logic is equivalent
