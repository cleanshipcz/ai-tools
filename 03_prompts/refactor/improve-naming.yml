content: |
  Improve the naming in this {{language}} code:

  ```{{language}}
  {{code}}
  ```

  {{#context}}
  Domain context: {{context}}
  {{/context}}

  Apply these naming principles:
  - Use intention-revealing names that explain purpose
  - Follow language conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
  - Make names searchable (avoid single letters except loop counters)
  - Use consistent terminology from the domain
  - Avoid mental mapping (don't make reader translate)
  - Use verbs for functions/methods, nouns for variables/classes

  Provide:
  1. **Refactored Code**: With improved names
  2. **Naming Changes**: Table of old → new names with rationale
  3. **Consistency Check**: Ensure domain terms are used consistently
