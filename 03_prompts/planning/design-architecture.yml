  Design architecture for:

  Requirements:
  {{requirements}}

  {{#constraints}}
  Constraints:
  {{constraints}}
  {{/constraints}}

  {{#existing_system}}
  Existing system:
  {{existing_system}}
  {{/existing_system}}

  Provide:

  1. **Problem Analysis**: Understanding of requirements and constraints

  2. **Proposed Architecture**: 
     - High-level component diagram (Mermaid)
     - Component responsibilities
     - Communication patterns

  3. **Alternative Approaches**: Other options considered
     - Pros and cons of each
     - Why the proposed approach was chosen

  4. **Key Design Decisions**:
     - Data storage strategy
     - API design
     - Security model
     - Error handling approach
     - Logging and monitoring

  5. **Technology Recommendations**:
     - Frameworks and libraries
     - Infrastructure requirements
     - Justification for choices

  6. **Integration Points**: How it connects to existing systems

  7. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
     - Performance targets
     - Scalability considerations
     - Security requirements
     - Reliability and availability

  8. **Risks and Mitigations**: Potential issues and how to address them
