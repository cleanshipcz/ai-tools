description: Implement user authentication system with JWT tokens and password hashing
model: gpt-5.1-codex # Feature-level override (highest priority in hierarchy)

context:
  overview: |
    Add a complete user authentication system to the application, including:
    - User registration and login endpoints
    - JWT token generation and validation
    - Password hashing with bcrypt
    - Protected routes middleware
    - Session management

  architecture: |
    The authentication system will follow a stateless JWT approach:
    - Auth routes in routes/auth.ts
    - User model with password hashing in models/User.ts
    - JWT middleware in middleware/auth.ts
    - Token refresh mechanism

  dependencies:
    - jsonwebtoken
    - bcrypt
    - express-validator

files:
  patterns:
    - src/routes/auth/**
    - src/middleware/auth/**
    - src/models/User.ts
    - src/services/AuthService.ts
    - tests/auth.test.ts

conventions:
  - 'Use async/await for all async operations'
  - 'Hash passwords with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)'
  - 'JWT tokens expire after 24 hours'
  - 'Refresh tokens expire after 7 days'
  - 'Use HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens'
  - 'Validate all inputs with express-validator'

      Implement a complete user authentication system with the following components:

      1. User Registration:
         - POST /api/auth/register
         - Validate email format and password strength
         - Hash password with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
         - Store user in database
         - Return JWT access token

      2. User Login:
         - POST /api/auth/login
         - Validate credentials
         - Generate JWT access token (24h expiry)
         - Generate refresh token (7d expiry, HTTP-only cookie)

      3. Token Refresh:
         - POST /api/auth/refresh
         - Validate refresh token from cookie
         - Generate new access token

      4. Protected Routes Middleware:
         - Verify JWT from Authorization header
         - Attach user object to request
         - Handle token expiration errors

      5. User Model:
         - Email (unique, indexed)
         - Password (hashed)
         - CreatedAt, UpdatedAt timestamps
         - comparePassword method

    acceptance_criteria: |
      - User can register with email and password
      - Password is hashed before storage (verify with bcrypt.compare)
      - User can login and receive JWT token
      - JWT token contains user ID and email
      - Protected routes reject requests without valid token
      - Protected routes accept requests with valid token
      - Token refresh endpoint generates new access token
      - All endpoints have comprehensive input validation
      - Unit tests cover happy path and edge cases
      - Integration tests verify authentication flow
      - Error messages are user-friendly and secure (no sensitive info)
      - Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
      - API documentation includes auth flow examples
