description: "A unified mono-repository for AI agent configuration - define once in YAML, deploy everywhere"

context:
  overview: |
    A comprehensive solution for managing AI agent prompts, rules, skills, and tool configurations.
    Keep your "source of truth" in small, typed YAML manifests and automatically generate
    tool-specific artifacts for Windsurf, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants.

    The repository provides a build system that transforms unified YAML manifests into
    tool-specific formats, ensuring consistency across different AI coding environments.
    It includes prompts for common tasks, agents for specific roles, rulepacks for coding standards,
    skills for tool integrations, and a project system for per-project configurations.

  purpose: "Enable teams to manage AI coding assistant configurations as code, with version control, validation, and automated deployment"

conventions:
  naming:
    - "Use kebab-case for manifest IDs (e.g., write-tests, code-reviewer)"
    - "Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., extract-method.yml)"
    - "Use camelCase for TypeScript functions and variables"
    - "Use PascalCase for TypeScript classes"

  patterns:
    - "All manifests must be YAML files with .yml extension"
    - "Follow JSON Schema definitions in schemas/ directory"
    - "Use semantic versioning for manifest versions (semver)"
    - "Include comprehensive descriptions (10-500 characters)"
    - "Organize manifests by category in appropriate directories"

  structure:
    - "prompts/ - Organized by category (refactor/, qa/, docs/)"
    - "agents/ - Agent manifests defining roles and behaviors"
    - "rulepacks/ - Coding standards and style rules"
    - "skills/ - Tool integrations and capabilities"
    - "projects/ - Project-specific configurations (global/ and local/)"
    - "schemas/ - JSON Schema definitions for validation"
    - "scripts/ - Build and utility scripts in TypeScript"
    - "adapters/ - Generated tool-specific outputs (gitignored)"

  testing:
    - "Use Vitest as the test framework for TypeScript code"
    - "Test files mirror source structure: 11_scripts/foo.ts → 11_scripts/foo.test.ts"
    - "Run tests via: npm test (will run vitest when implemented)"
    - "All TypeScript scripts in 11_scripts/ should have corresponding .test.ts files"
    - "Test coverage target: 80% for new code"
    - "Run npm run validate before committing"
    - "Ensure all schemas pass validation"
    - "Test generated outputs with npm run build"
    - "Verify tool-specific adapters are correct"

  documentation:
    - "Update README.md for user-facing features"
    - "Document new manifest types in appropriate docs/"
    - "Include examples in manifest files"
    - "Keep CHANGELOG.md updated for releases"
    - "Add helpful comments in YAML manifests"
