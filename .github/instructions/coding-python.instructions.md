# Python coding standards and best practices

- Be precise and accurate in your responses.
- Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter.
- If you are unsure, ask for clarification instead of guessing.
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- Verify your work before presenting it.
- Use clear, concise language.
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it.
- Document non-obvious decisions and trade-offs.
- Search for up-to-date information and resources.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use type hints for function arguments and return values.
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting.
- Use list/dict comprehensions where they improve readability.
- Handle exceptions explicitly; avoid bare except clauses.
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes (Google or NumPy style).
- Use pathlib for file path operations instead of os.path.
- Prefer context managers (with statements) for resource management.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations where appropriate.
