# Kotlin coding standards and best practices

- Be precise and accurate in your responses.
- Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter.
- If you are unsure, ask for clarification instead of guessing.
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- Verify your work before presenting it.
- Use clear, concise language.
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it.
- Document non-obvious decisions and trade-offs.
- Search for up-to-date information and resources.
- Prefer immutable data classes over mutable classes.
- Use suspend functions and Structured Concurrency for async operations.
- Public APIs must be null-safe; use explicit nullable types when needed.
- Adopt JUnit5 + MockK + AssertJ for testing as per project policy.
- Use sealed classes for restricted class hierarchies.
- Prefer extension functions over utility classes.
- Use scope functions (let, run, apply, also, with) appropriately.
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions for naming and formatting.
- Use data classes for value objects.
- Leverage Kotlin's stdlib functions (map, filter, fold, etc.).
