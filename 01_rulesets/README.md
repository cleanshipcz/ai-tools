# Rulesets

Reusable collections of coding guidelines and best practices. Mix and match to create custom coding standards.

## 📁 What's Here

- **base.yml** - Universal coding standards (naming, formatting, documentation)
- **security.yml** - Security best practices (input validation, secrets handling)
- **coding-python.yml** - Python-specific conventions (PEP 8, type hints)
- **coding-kotlin.yml** - Kotlin-specific conventions (naming, null safety)
- **coding-typescript.yml** - TypeScript-specific conventions (strict mode, type safety)
- **coding-java.yml** - Java-specific conventions (naming, patterns)
- **testing.yml** - Testing standards and TDD principles
- **reviewer.yml** - Code review guidelines
- **docs-base.yml** - Core documentation principles (DRY, clarity, examples)
- **docs-api.yml** - API and code documentation standards (extends docs-base)
- **docs-project.yml** - Project documentation standards (README, guides, extends docs-base)
- **windsurf-defaults.yml** - Windsurf IDE default rules

## 🎯 Purpose

Rulesets are **building blocks** for agents. Instead of duplicating rules across agents, create reusable rulesets that can be composed together.

**Example:**

```yaml
# agents/my-agent.yml
rulesets:
  - base # Everyone needs good fundamentals
  - security # Add security checks
  - coding-python # Python-specific rules
```

This agent now has ALL rules from all three rulesets!

## 🔧 How to Use in Different Tools

### Windsurf

Rulesets are automatically bundled into agents when you import them.

1. Build the configs:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Import an agent (which includes its rulesets):

   ```bash
   # In Windsurf: Settings → Cascade → Rules
   # Import: adapters/windsurf/rules/code-reviewer.json
   ```

3. The `code-reviewer` agent includes these rulesets:
   - `base` - Fundamental coding standards
   - `reviewer` - Review-specific guidelines
   - `security` - Security checks

**View what's included:**

```bash
cat adapters/windsurf/rules/code-reviewer.json
# Look for the "rules" array - it contains all merged rules
```

### Cursor

Same as Windsurf - rulesets are bundled into agents:

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Import: `adapters/cursor/recipes.json`
3. Rulesets are merged into each recipe

### Claude Code

Rulesets are merged into agent prompts:

```bash
cat adapters/claude-code/agents/code-reviewer.json
# The "system" field contains all rules
```

### Manual Use

If you want to use rulesets directly (outside of agents):

1. Read the YAML file:

   ```bash
   cat 01_rulesets/base.yml
   ```

2. Copy the `rules` array

3. Add to your tool's custom instructions

## 📝 Creating Your Own Rulesets

### Basic Ruleset

```yaml
# 01_rulesets/my-team-rules.yml
id: my-team-rules
version: 1.0.0
description: Our team's coding standards
rules:
  - 'Use meaningful variable names'
  - 'Functions should do one thing'
  - 'Maximum 50 lines per function'
  - 'Write tests for all public APIs'
  - 'Document complex logic'
```

### Extending Other Rulesets

```yaml
# 01_rulesets/my-python-rules.yml
id: my-python-rules
version: 1.0.0
description: Our Python standards
extends:
  - base # Include all base rules
  - coding-python # Include Python rules
rules:
  # Add your team-specific rules
  - 'Use Black for formatting'
  - 'Prefer dataclasses over dictionaries'
  - 'Type hints on all public functions'
```

**Inheritance chain:**

```
my-python-rules
  ├─ base
  │   └─ (fundamental rules)
  ├─ coding-python
  │   └─ base (inherited)
  │   └─ (Python-specific rules)
  └─ (team-specific rules)
```

All rules are merged together when building!

### Best Practices

**Good Rules:**

```yaml
rules:
  - 'Use descriptive variable names (not x, y, z)'
  - 'Prefer early returns over nested if statements'
  - 'Maximum cyclomatic complexity: 10'
```

**Bad Rules:**

```yaml
rules:
  - 'Be good' # Too vague
  - "Don't write bad code" # Not actionable
  - 'Follow best practices' # What practices?
```

**Rules should be:**

- ✅ Specific and actionable
- ✅ Measurable (can be checked)
- ✅ Justified (explain why)
- ✅ Consistent with other rules

## 🔍 Validation

```bash
npm run validate
```

Checks:

- Valid YAML syntax
- Required fields (id, version, description)
- Unique IDs across all manifests
- Valid semantic versioning
- Extends refers to existing rulesets
- No circular dependencies

## 🔨 Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Process:

1. Load all rulesets
2. Resolve inheritance (extends)
3. Merge rules into agents
4. Generate tool-specific configs

**Output:**

```
adapters/
├── windsurf/rules/
│   ├── code-reviewer.json    (includes base, reviewer, security rules)
│   ├── bug-fixer.json         (includes base rules)
│   └── ...
├── cursor/recipes.json        (all agents with merged rules)
└── claude-code/agents/        (agents with rules in system prompt)
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Composition over Duplication

**Bad:**

```yaml
# agents/python-reviewer.yml
rules:
  - 'Use meaningful names'
  - 'Functions under 50 lines'
  - 'Check for SQL injection'
  - 'Follow PEP 8'
  - 'Use type hints'
  # ... 50+ rules duplicated across agents
```

**Good:**

```yaml
# agents/python-reviewer.yml
rulesets:
  - base
  - security
  - coding-python
  - reviewer
# Rules are reused, not duplicated!
```

### Layered Architecture

```
base
  ↓ (extended by)
coding-python ──→ my-python-rules
  ↓                     ↓
security         my-team-rules
  ↓ (all used in)       ↓
agent: python-security-reviewer
```

### Single Responsibility

Each ruleset should focus on ONE concern:

- ✅ `security` - Only security rules
- ✅ `coding-python` - Only Python conventions
- ❌ `python-security-docs` - Too broad, split it

## 💡 Tips

### Finding the Right Granularity

**Too granular:**

```yaml
01_rulesets/python-naming.yml
01_rulesets/python-imports.yml
01_rulesets/python-types.yml
01_rulesets/python-docs.yml
```

Too many files, hard to manage.

**Too broad:**

```yaml
01_rulesets/everything-python.yml # 200+ rules
```

Hard to reuse, monolithic.

**Just right:**

```yaml
rulesets/coding-python.yml  # 20-30 focused rules
rulesets/testing-python.yml # Test-specific rules
```

### Versioning Strategy

- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes (removing rules, changing meaning)
- **MINOR:** Adding new rules (backward compatible)
- **PATCH:** Clarifications, typo fixes

### Testing Your Rules

1. Create an agent using your ruleset
2. Build and import into your tool
3. Test with real code scenarios
4. Iterate based on actual usage

```bash
npm run build
# Import into Windsurf/Cursor
# Write some code and see if AI follows the rules
```
