  Estimate effort for:

  Feature: {{feature}}

  {{#context}}
  Context: {{context}}
  {{/context}}

  {{#team_experience}}
  Team experience: {{team_experience}}
  {{/team_experience}}

  Provide:

  1. **Task Breakdown**: Decompose into estimatable units
     - Development tasks
     - Testing tasks
     - Documentation tasks
     - Deployment/DevOps tasks

  2. **Effort Estimates**: For each task
     - Optimistic estimate (best case)
     - Realistic estimate (most likely)
     - Pessimistic estimate (worst case)
     - Use three-point estimation: (Optimistic + 4×Realistic + Pessimistic) / 6

  3. **Complexity Factors**:
     - Technical complexity
     - Domain complexity
     - Integration complexity
     - Testing complexity

  4. **Dependencies**: External dependencies that could delay work

  5. **Risks and Unknowns**: Things that could increase estimates
     - Technical unknowns
     - API changes required
     - Database migrations
     - Learning curve for new technologies

  6. **Total Estimate**: 
     - Sum of all tasks
     - Add 20-30% buffer for unknowns
     - Express in story points or ideal days

  7. **Confidence Level**: How confident are we in this estimate?

  8. **Assumptions**: What assumptions is this estimate based on?
