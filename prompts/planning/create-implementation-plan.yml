  Create implementation plan for:

  Project: {{project}}

  {{#team_size}}
  Team size: {{team_size}} developers
  {{/team_size}}

  {{#timeline}}
  Timeline: {{timeline}}

  Provide:

  1. **Project Overview**: Summary and goals

  2. **Phases**: Break project into logical phases
     - Phase 1: Foundation (core functionality)
     - Phase 2: Features (main capabilities)
     - Phase 3: Polish (UX, performance, docs)

  3. **Task Breakdown**: For each phase:
     - Specific tasks with descriptions
     - Estimated effort (story points or hours)
     - Dependencies on other tasks
     - Required skills/expertise

  4. **Timeline**: 
     - Gantt chart or phase timeline
     - Key milestones
     - Deliverables at each milestone

  5. **Critical Path**: Tasks that could block progress

  6. **Risk Management**:
     - Technical risks
     - Resource risks
     - Mitigation strategies

  7. **Testing Strategy**: When and how testing happens

  8. **Deployment Plan**: How to roll out incrementally

  9. **Success Metrics**: How to measure completion and quality
