  Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for:

  Decision: {{decision}}

  {{#context}}
  Context: {{context}}
  {{/context}}

  - **Pros**: Benefits
  - **Cons**: Drawbacks

  ## Rationale

  Why did we choose this approach over the alternatives?

  - What assumptions are we making?

  ## Consequences

  ### Positive
  - What benefits do we gain?

  ### Negative
  - What costs or limitations do we accept?

  ### Neutral
